# How to reference an external workbook


This example demonstrates how to insert an external reference link from a workbook to another workbook. <br>An external workbook is created andÂ populated with random data by importing a data table at runtime.<br>Subsequently the workbook is added to theÂ <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Spreadsheet.ExternalWorkbookCollection.class">ExternalWorkbookCollection</a>. <br>A cell formula with a reference to an external workbook is inserted in the current worksheet. The worksheet is saved to .XLSX file and opened with an application registered for that file format.<br><br>See also theÂ <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/14916/Spreadsheet-Document-API/Cell-Basics/Cell-Referencing">Cell Referencing</a>Â documentation topic available online.<br><br>The<strong> Universal Subscription</strong> or an additional <strong>Office File API Subscription</strong> is required to use this example in production code.
