# Spreadsheet Document API - Insert a Reference to an External Workbook

This example demonstrates how to insert an external reference link from a workbook to another workbook. 

An external workbook is created andÂ populated with random data by importing a data table at runtime. Subsequently, the workbook is added to theÂ [ExternalWorkbookCollection](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.Spreadsheet.ExternalWorkbookCollection). A cell formula with a reference to an external workbook is inserted in the current worksheet. The worksheet is saved to .XLSX file and opened with an application registered for that file format.

> The **Universal Subscription** or an additional **Office File API Subscription** is required to use this example in production code. Please refer to the [DevExpress Subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/Buy/NET/)Â page for pricing information.
