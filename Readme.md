The worksheet is saved to .XLSX file and opened with an application registered for that file format.<br><br>See also the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/14916/Spreadsheet-Document-API/Cell-Basics/Cell-Referencing">Cell Referencing</a> documentation topic available online.<br><br>The<strong> Universal Subscription</strong> or an additional <strong>Office File API Subscription</strong> is required to use this example in production code.
